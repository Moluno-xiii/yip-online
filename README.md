# Welcome to my Sample Expo app

## How to run the application

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moluno-xiii/yip-online
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Install 'Expo go' app on your Android or Ios device.
5. Scan the QR code on the command line when you ran the app with 'npm start' on the installed Expo go app (on Android) and with your camera (on IOS).

## Happy hacking!
